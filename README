#Macos common problem

Pproblem installing DBD::mysql

I started by running (MacOX Mojave 10.14.1):

brew install mysql
cpan install DBD::mysql
This fails.
This gave me the error message "Can't link/include C library 'ssl', 'crypto', aborting". As per this thread and the DBD::mysql install instructions on meta-cpan, this error is happening because the DBD::mysql package requires (?) "mysql-connector-c" rather than "mysql". Okay, I fixed that by doing:

brew unlink mysql
brew install mysql-connector-c
cpan install DBD::mysql

The cpan install still fails, but new error!

That "fixed" the issue in that it got me a different error message. I was now getting the message: "Can't link/include C library'', aborting". Progress! Now I was getting the error on this answer. I fixed this error by:

Verifying that my problem is indeed from missing linkage flags.

Run mysql_config

This returns something like: --libs [L/usr/local/Cellar/mysql-connector-c/6.1.11/lib -l]

Note that the "-l" at the end has nothing after it, which is incorrect.

Edit /usr/local/Cellar/mysql-connector-c/6.1.11/bin/mysql_config line #114

Change libs="$libs -l" to libs="$libs -lmysqlclient"

Verify that it worked: mysql_config

This should return something like: --libs [L/usr/local/Cellar/mysql-connector-c/6.1.11/lib -lmysqlclient]

Again do cpanm install DBD::mysql

This time it works!!!
Be wary: We're not installing the lib for SSL connections which will probably cause cryptic problems later.
This got DBD::mysql installed successfully for me. I do think I'm going to have to go back and add some more linkage flags.
